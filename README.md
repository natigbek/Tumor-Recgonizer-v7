Predicting Tumor Size Using AI Model in Google Colab
Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide to utilizing Google Colab for building an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict melanoma tumor size based on a dataset hosted on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/machine-hack-melanoma-tumor-size-prediction?select=test.csv). Specifically, the dataset used for this project is the Machine Hack Melanoma Tumor Size Prediction dataset, which includes various features such as mass_npea, size_npear, malign_ratio, damage_size, exposed_area, std_dev_malign, err_malign, and malign_penalty. The goal is to leverage these features to train a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the tumor size.

The model will be built using Python, employing popular machine learning libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras within a Google Colab environment. Google Colab offers a cloud-based Jupyter notebook interface, which allows seamless execution of Python code in the cloud with powerful hardware acceleration options such as GPUs, making it ideal for building AI models efficiently.
